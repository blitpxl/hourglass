# Features
- **Dynamic Color**

  Hourglass can automatically adapt and change its color to match the currently applied wallpaper.

- **Higly Customizable**

  Hourglass can be extensively customized, from the font's *family*, *size*, *boldness* and *color* to the layout can be customized to your likings.
For further customization, Hourglass supports subset of html with css-like styling that you can use to customize the layout and appearance. See [Supported HTML Subset](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/richtext-html-subset.html)

  Hourglass also support python's strftime for time formatting to get the current time units such as hours, seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months, and year. See [Python strftime reference cheatsheets](https://strftime.org/)

- **Easy to customize**

  Hourglass comes with hourglass-configurator, a graphical user interface to make customizing easy!

# Future Goals
- Implement a plugin-like architecture to the application to further extend the customizability of hourglass. E.g: to allow Hourglass to interact with weather api to display the current weather on the desktop.
- Allow the user to change the widget's alignment. For now the implemented alignment is on the middle of the screen.

# Supports
I have devoted a lot of time into making free and open source software that everybody can use. If you think I deserve something in return feel free to help me buy my groceries. If not no worries.
